In this competitive world, Most drivers get healthy number of rides from customers throughout the day. But with the recent hikes in gas and electricity prices, many drivers complain that their profits are not increasing although their revenue is increasing. It is very important to choose the right rides for drivers which helps to maximize their profits throughout the day. In our project, we are using Reinforcement Learning for assisting cab drivers to maximize the profits for them.

The goal of our project is to build an RL-based algorithm which can help cab drivers maximize their profits by improving their decision-making process on the field.

For example, say a driver gets three ride requests at 3 PM. The first one is a long-distance ride guaranteeing high fare, but it will take him to a location which is unlikely to get him another ride for the next few hours. The second one ends in a better location, but it requires him to take a slight detour to pick the customer up, adding to fuel costs. Perhaps the best choice is to choose the third one, which although is medium distance, it will likely get him another ride subsequently and avoid most of the traffic.
